*** Please read the compiling and usage sections at a minimum ***

-- Changes
The main changes see much of the program split into smaller files.  They are now compiled with the correct compiler,
so c++ for cpp files, and gcc for c files.  These are compiled to object files and linked.  This was done to get around
the mess of compiling C with a C++ compiler.  I changed header files so that they matched the associated objects. As a 
result, I had to change the make files, too.  I removed the runClient.cpp program as a shell script is more appropriate.

-- Compiling
To compile this program, 'cd' into either the server or client folders and run make.  You need to have 'bin' and 'exec' folders (should be empty) and 'src' containing the source files.

-- Usage
To use the program, you start the server.  This sets the video source up, and then waits for 10 seconds.  You need to ensure the client connects in this time, as after this time, the header is sent.  Only one header is sent as due to the nature of the player/client, it is not possible to send more than one header - it confuses VLC and the file becomes invalid.

Once the header is received, you will notice that the player starts at about 200 frames received. If you pipe the client output to a file, you get a valid MKV file (mkvtoolnix approved), and it plays in VLC, Mplayer, and Totem - It also has test audio.  This release doesn't contain microphone audio, but a test sweep tone.

-- Issues
 * Only one header is sent.  If the sync is lost, it should recover with the old header - if not, then it's currently tough.
